This is our final project for our Web Development subject that we did when I was 2nd year. I am the only one who made the entire code of this project since my groupmates cant code properly. 
I tried once to let them code and it just made a big disaster to our project. I handled the frontend, backend and the database where I used PHPMYADMIN MySQL. The mistakes that I did in this 
website especially in the database is not adding a foreign key for normalization which resulted in duplication of data.
